# Social makers

This platform is designed to foster creativity, promote sustainable practices, and empower makers worldwide. Letâ€™s make waste a thing of the past and creativity a cornerstone of the future.

# About

I (gustavo_hen@hotmail.com) conceived, designed, developed, and researched the entire project during a freelancer contract, which serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC).

Version 1.0 with multilingual support ready, and I am sharing its source code for any purpose.
